The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\WINDOWS\TPS\Visual Basic 6\VB6 Programs\Misc\Explorer\Package\Explorer.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\WINDOWS\TPS\Visual Basic 6\VB6 Programs\Misc\Explorer\Package\Support\Explorer.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
